		<h1> Challenge</h1>
			<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>I think my major problem I had was actually figuring out what I am making the JavaScript do. I understand it as much as following along with the directions but beyond that I was getting pretty confused. I understand that I was making the letters become jambled but the actual writing of the JavaScript was what was making feel a little lost. After I finised writing the script I went back and reviewed the lecture which help me a lot I think with a little more practice i'll start to fully understand it.</p>

		<h1> Challenge</h1>
			<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>I think the major problem I had was actually figuring out what I am making the JavaScript do. I understand it as much as following along with the directions but beyond that, I was getting pretty confused. I understand that I was making the letters become jumbled but the actual writing of the JavaScript was what was making me feel a little lost. After I finished writing the script I went back and reviewed the lecture which helps me a lot I think with a little more practice I’ll start to fully understand it. I was also struggling with seeing my JavaScript on my site I realized I had a lot of typos with the .js file itself but even after it still wasn’t showing up. I asked my lab partner too for help and after he sent his Html file did I realize I had forgotten to put the backslash on the closing of "script". </p>

		<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
		<p> I am a Senior Art Major at UCSC. I am originally from San Diego but have been living in Monterey, CA for some years now. I like to paint, whether it be acrylic, watercolor, gouche, or even through digital programs. I have two dogs, Max and Lola, and one cat, Stewart. An interesting fact about me is that I am an identical twin.

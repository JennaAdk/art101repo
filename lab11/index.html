      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>This Lab was pretty difficult to understand at first but after watching the lecture over and looking at w3Schools, it really helped me realize
          what I was doing wrong. First, my bigest mistake was not starting and experimenting with the console. Using the console on the browser
          really helped me figure out my biggest problems because I could see the changes immediatly rather than going back and forth and forgetting the changes
          I've made. Also, I was having a really hard time just creating the buttons using just jQuery and also creating them so they would replace the div itself.
          I figured this out by looking through w3Schools and found that .append is what helped me the most instead of adding the buttons directly to the div.
          After I was finally getting the hang of it, the rest of the lab came really easily.
    </div>
    <div id= "results">
      <h2 >Results</h2>
        <p> As the result I was able to add clickable button that toggle the .special class. I also added css which includes changing the button colors when hovering
          and having the content transition into a confined border with a slight animation.

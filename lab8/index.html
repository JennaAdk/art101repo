		<h1> Challenge</h1>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p> At first, starting this lab I was a little confused about what I was supposed to make functions of but after looking at the references I realized what I had to do. Although I was a little nervous because math is not my "forte" so I was messing around with the function until I was able to figure out a problem that would work which ended up being the one closest to the reference, but once I got the hang of creating the functions it was actually really enjoyable to figure out and it was almost like solving a puzzle. I wanted to try out task x too but I was having difficulties making the results appear on the site. I didnâ€™t quite understand how to mess with the template given but it is something I would like to learn how to do.

		<h1>Results</h1>
      <p>Go to the Console to see the output.</p>

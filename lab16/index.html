				<p>I was really confused through out this lab. It took me a long time to actually process what I was doing. I now realized I made it much harder than It actually was. I was also having
					problems with the CORS unblock but I finally realized that after clicking the extension it allows it to work with solved a lot of my problems. This lab was pretty difficult for me but
		  		after referencing back to the jsfiddle I realized I was doing everything all wrong and way to complicated. Im happy I was able to finally get the results but I plan on possibly coming back
		 			and try to experiment with the bonus task but as of now I'm glad I got this far in the lab.</p>

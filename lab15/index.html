      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>The main problems I came across from this lab was finding an API that work or least was simple to use. I also was confused on what some of the websites were asking but eventually

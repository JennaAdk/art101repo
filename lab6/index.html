		<h1> Challenge</h1>
			<p>The objective of this lab was to experiement using the console and JavaScript file to test out array and object lists. Then I had to print it out into my html's browser and add css and an img file of my car that I've described. </p>

		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>I was struggling for a bit trying to get the JavaScripts printed into the html browser correctly and I went back and forth looking at the directions and checking my spelling and typos. I finally realized that I accidentally added a parenthesis after the first "pre" in the "myMainRide" document.writeln instead of a comma. I also was having some struggle with putting css on the javaScript output. Otherwise, this lab was very easy to understand and complete.</p>

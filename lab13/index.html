      <h2 id="probs">Problems</h2>
        <p>The coding of this lab was pretty simple to get through considering it was the same as what we were working on in lecture. I mostly had difficulties showing the
        output in my site. I eventually got it though because I realized I was mixing two of the recomended ways of outputing the Javascript. For the rest of the lab, I really focused
        on how to show the output in a boxed area so it would be easier to see the results rather than scrolling all the way to the bottom. I had some difficutlies with this but I had
        finally figured it out. My only problem I couldn't figure out was making the margin under the output table to have more space.</p>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I didn't have any bugging problems in my last labs so my goal of this lab was to complete the Task X portion of some of the labs that I couldn't figure out before.
        I started with Lab7 and I was able to add the name tag image as well as the output being posted on the image. I also added a shuffle function for the
        name tag output while the script output stays with my original javascript code. I had a ton of debugging to do with this lab but eventually I was able to find all the
        problems and fixed them. Lab 8 was a little more tricky but I was able to finaly get the output showing on the site I referenced multiple labs to figure this one out. I also
        had to debug this lab multiple times due to the addition of the outputing onto the site. For a while it kept giving me an error but I was finally able to figure out that it was a
        typo error. Lab 10 was really simple because I was able to implement the shuffle/anagram function from lab 7 into this lab.</p>

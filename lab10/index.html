          <h1> Challenge</h1>
						<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JS events.</p>

        	<h1>Problems</h1>
						<p>The lab was pretty understandable to set up with some minor
							errors with seeing the final output. However, my major problems
							occured when I had to actually sort the output. I was
							having such a hard time trying to understand the directions
							because I didnt know whether I was supposed to create a separate
							function for the sort or not. I eventually was able to 
							figure it out with great help from Michael. I literally could not
							understand what I was doing wrong and he helped me so much with
							this Lab. </p>

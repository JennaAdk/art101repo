		<h1> Challenge</h1>
			<p>The goal of this lab was to write data using JavaScript with the variables; make, model, color, year, and age of my car. I then had to link the JavaScript to my html.  </p>

		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p> I didnt really have any major problems working on this lab. I thought it was pretty straight foward for me. My only problem I had was understanding what writing the JavaScript in "Sublime" meant.</p>

		<h1>Results</h1>

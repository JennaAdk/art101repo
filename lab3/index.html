		<h1> File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The main idea of this lab was to create a local file structure, which in my case is located under art101repo, and add a new index.html file to create our "Homepage". This lab also wanted the site to then be published and uploaded to the server."</p>
	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p> My biggest challenge was figuring out how to upload the content to my github website but i was finally able to figure it out.I also had some difficulties uploading an image file into the html but I was also eventually figure that out too. Realizing that the image had to be directly added into the img file that's relevent to the folder, then I was able to scr the image into the html.</p>

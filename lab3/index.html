	<h1> File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The main idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>
	<h2> Challenges</h2>
	<p> My biggest challenge was figuring out how to upload the content to my github website but i was finally able to figure it out. I also had some difficulties uploading an image file into the html but I was also eventually figure that out too.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Here is the results of the file structure that I made.</p>
